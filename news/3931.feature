Add a field ``webstats_head_js`` to the Site controlpanel and render its
contents in the head section using ``IHtmlHeadLinks`` viewlet manager.
See `issue 3931 <https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3931>`_:
some javascript needs to be loaded at the bottom of the page, and some in the head section.
